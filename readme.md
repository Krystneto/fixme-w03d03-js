# Fix Me!

Start up a server and take a look at `index.html`

When a user enters a row and column and clicks "Mark" the face at 
that space should change. 

Read through the accompanying code in `main.js`

Can you add in jQuery and refactor the code to use jQuery?

# Bonus

Can you update the the code to include to a click event
to mark faces?
